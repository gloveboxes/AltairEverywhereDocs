# Connect the Altair emulator to Azure IoT Central

To securely connect the Altair emulator to Azure IoT Central you need to create a device ID and a derived device key.

## Install the Azure CLI tools

Follow the [How to install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) guide to install the Azure CLI on your computer.

## Create an IoT Central enrollment group

From the Azure IoT Central web portal, follow these steps.

1. Select **Permissions** from the sidebar menu.
1. Select **Device connection groups**.
1. Select **+New** to create a new enrollment group.
1. Name your group **altair-emulator**.
1. Select **Shared access signature** attestation type.
1. Select **Save**
1. While on this page, copy the **ID scope** of your Azure IoT Central application somewhere safe. You will need the *ID scope** when you start the Altair emulator.

## Create a device key

1. Open a Terminal window on your computer and run the [compute-device-key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/iot/central/device?view=azure-cli-latest#az-iot-central-device-compute-device-key) command to generate a device-derived key. Notes.
    - You will likely be prompted to install the azure-iot extension. Select **Y**, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
    - The primary key is the primary key generated by your newly created IoT Central enrollment group.
    - The device id is any arbitrary/sensible name, for example, myAltair.

    ```bash
    az iot central device compute-device-key --pk {primaryKey} --device-id {deviceid}
    ```

1. Copy the **Device ID**, and the **Derived key** somewhere safe as you will need these values  when you start the Altair emulator in cloud-connected mode.
