## Azure Sphere

[Azure Sphere](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-sphere/) is a secure embedded platform that is ideal for quickly developing an IoT system. By providing a platform meeting all [7 properties of highly secured devices](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2020/11/Seven-Properties-of-Highly-Secured-Devices-2nd-Edition-R1.pdf), Azure Sphere eliminates the need to be a hardware, OS, and security expert. These seven properties make Azure Sphere ideal for running Intelligent Edge solutions.

Azure Sphere consists of the following components:

- **Azure Sphere OS** adds layers of protection and ongoing security updates to create a trustworthy platform for new IoT experiences.
- **Azure Sphere Security Service** brokers trust for device-to-cloud communication, detects threats and renews device security.

## Altair on Azure Sphere

The Altair emulator is supported on Azure Sphere devices from Avnet and Seeed Studio. If an Azure Sphere device is paired with the [Altair front panel kit](https://github.com/AzureSphereCloudEnabledAltair8800/AzureSphereAltair8800.Hardware) or the [Mikroe Altair Retro Click](https://www.mikroe.com/blog/8800-retro-click), the Altair address and data bus activity are displayed.

## Ideal Azure Sphere config

The ideal Azure Sphere configuration is the Avnet Azure Sphere Starter Kit paired with the [MikroE microSD Click](https://www.mikroe.com/microsd-click) and the [MikroE 8800 Retro Click](https://www.mikroe.com/8800-retro-click).
