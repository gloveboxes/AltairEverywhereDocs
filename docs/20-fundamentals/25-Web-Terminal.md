# Start the web terminal

The Altair web terminal is a remote terminal command prompt for the Altair emulator. The web terminal is a static web app and is hosted in your web browser and connects to the Altair emulator. When the web terminal connects, the Altair terminal reports the emulator and CP/M versions, and you can start to use the Altair.

Note, there are links on the web terminal to the retro games GitHub repo, the documentation, and user and programming manuals.
