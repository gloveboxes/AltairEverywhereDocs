# Install developer tools

## Troubleshooting

1. If you have trouble connecting to the Azure Sphere over USB be sure to disable any VPNs you might have enabled.
2. The **TAP-Windows Adapter V9** installed with VPN clients, including the OpenVPN client is not compatible with the **TAP-Windows Adapter V9** required and installed by the Azure Sphere SDK. You will need to uninstall the VPN client and reinstall the Azure Sphere SDK for Visual Studio.
3. Windows Users. If running the IoT Central ShowIoTCentralConfig command fails with a missing library message then delete the folder from ShowIoTCentralConfig from AppData\\Local\\Temp\\.net.

## Ubuntu users

Azure Sphere development is supported on Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 LTS.

You need to do the following:

1. Install the Azure Sphere SDK.
1. Set up the device connection.
1. Install CMake and Ninja.
1. Install Visual Studio Code.
1. Install the Visual Studio Code Azure Sphere extension.
1. Claim your device.
1. Configure networking for the device.

The [Quickstart: Install the Azure Sphere SDK for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/install/install-sdk-linux?pivots=vs-code-linux) will step you through the process.

### Install the Git client for Linux

The Git client is required to clone the *Predictive Maintenance* solution to your computer.

```bash
sudo apt install git
```

### Install the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain for Linux

Install the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain for Linux

1. Download the latest [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads?azure-portal=true).
2. Install the downloaded package. The following command installs the toolchain in the /opt directory. Note, you will need to update the filename to match the version you downloaded.

    ```bash
    sudo tar -xjvf gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2 -C /opt
    ```

3. Update your path. Open ~/.bashrc and add to the end.

    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:/opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10/bin
    ```
